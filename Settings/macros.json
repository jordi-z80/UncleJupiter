	// Every command has an action associated. 
	// This file is used to avoid hardcoding paths to actions, and be able to easily change preferred browsers.

	"VLC": "\"C:\\Program Files\\VideoLAN\\VLC\\vlc.exe\"",
	
	// Yes, I still use WinAmp
	"WINAMP": "\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Winamp\\winamp.exe\"",

	// It is not mandatory and can be replaced, however you'll have to change the commands too.
